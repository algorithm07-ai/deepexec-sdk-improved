# Security Model

## Overview

The DeepExec SDK implements a comprehensive security model to protect against various threats associated with code execution and AI text generation. This document outlines the security controls, their implementation, and best practices for secure usage.

## Threat Model

The SDK addresses the following key threats:

1. **Code Injection**: Malicious code execution attempts
2. **Resource Exhaustion**: Excessive resource consumption
3. **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
4. **API Key Exposure**: Exposure of DeepSeek or E2B API keys
5. **Prompt Injection**: Manipulating AI model behavior through crafted inputs

## Security Controls

### Code Execution Security

#### Sandboxed Execution

All code execution occurs within E2B's sandboxed environments, which provide:

- Isolated execution contexts
- Resource limitations
- Network access controls
- Ephemeral environments that are destroyed after execution

#### Code Validation

Before execution, code is validated through multiple checks:

1. **Length Limits**: Configurable maximum code length
2. **Language Restrictions**: Configurable list of allowed programming languages
3. **Keyword Blocking**: Detection of potentially dangerous operations

```typescript
// Example configuration
const client = new DeepExecClient({
  securityOptions: {
    maxCodeLength: 5000,
    allowedLanguages: ['python', 'javascript'],
    blockedKeywords: ['rm -rf', 'System.exit', 'os.system']
  }
});
```

#### Timeout Controls

All code execution operations have configurable timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion:

```typescript
// Example with custom timeout
const result = await client.executeCode(code, 'python', 10); // 10 second timeout
```

### API Security

#### Authentication

The SDK uses API keys for authentication with both DeepSeek and E2B services. These keys should be kept secure and never exposed in client-side code.

Best practices for API key management:

1. Store keys in environment variables
2. Use different keys for development and production
3. Implement key rotation policies
4. Set appropriate access restrictions on the API keys

#### Transport Security

All communication with external services uses HTTPS/WSS with TLS 1.2+. Certificate validation is enabled by default but can be configured:

```typescript
const client = new DeepExecClient({
  verifySSL: true // Default is true
});
```

### AI Model Security

#### Input Validation

All inputs to AI models are validated to prevent prompt injection attacks:

1. Maximum input length limits
2. Content filtering for potentially malicious prompts
3. Context isolation between sessions

#### Output Filtering

Model outputs are filtered to prevent potential harmful content:

1. Detection of potentially unsafe content
2. Configurable content filtering levels

## Security Configuration

The SDK's security features are configurable through the `ClientConfig` class:

```typescript
const client = new DeepExecClient({
  // Basic security settings
  verifySSL: true,
  timeout: 30.0,
  
  // Advanced security options
  securityOptions: {
    maxCodeLength: 10000,
    allowedLanguages: ['python', 'javascript', 'typescript'],
    blockedKeywords: ['rm -rf', 'System.exit', 'os.system'],
  }
});
```

## Security Best Practices

### For SDK Users

1. **Keep SDK Updated**: Always use the latest version of the SDK to benefit from security patches
2. **Validate User Inputs**: Implement application-level validation of all user inputs
3. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by implementing rate limiting in your application
4. **Use Principle of Least Privilege**: Only enable the features and languages your application needs
5. **Monitor Usage**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual patterns

### For SDK Developers

1. **Security Testing**: Regularly perform security testing, including:
   - Static code analysis
   - Dynamic testing
   - Dependency scanning
2. **Code Review**: Implement mandatory security-focused code reviews
3. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and monitor for vulnerabilities
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear security documentation and update it with each release

## Incident Response

If you discover a security vulnerability in the DeepExec SDK, please report it by:

1. Emailing security@deepgeek.com with details of the vulnerability
2. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed

The security team will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.

## Compliance

The DeepExec SDK is designed to help applications comply with various security standards and regulations, including:

- OWASP Top 10
- SANS Top 25
- GDPR (for applications processing personal data)

However, compliance ultimately depends on how the SDK is integrated and used within your application.
